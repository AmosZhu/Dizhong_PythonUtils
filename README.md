# Dizhong_PythonUtils
I am trying to migrate something I used daily into python package.

It will include utilities functions like I used for pytorch and some notebooks for easy explanation.

### Notebooks
Please refer the notebooks of different examples I provide. To run them you might need to install following packages.
- pytorch
- pytorch3d
- open3D
- plotly
- opencv

I put colab link in each notebook.
